# Intialize a new instance

Plug and play exports a function which accepts the following options:

* `args`   
  Arguments passed to the plugin when it is defined as a function.
* `parent`   
  A parent Plug and Play instance, unless sorted with `after` and `before`, child hooks are executed before the parent hooks by default.
* `plugins`   
  A list of plugins to be initially registered. Plugins can later be registered with the `register` function.

Note, all options are optional.
