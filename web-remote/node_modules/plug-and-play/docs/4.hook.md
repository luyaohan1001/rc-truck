# Hook

A hook is called at a specific location in the code called the interception point identified by a `string`. Plugins registered one or multiple hooks which name must match the interception point. When the interception point is reached, all the hooks registered in the plugins are executed.

## Definition

Hooks are inside a plugins. A plugins can be seen as a group of related hooks. They are defined as object literals. You can register one or multiple hooks at once by providing an array. Defining the hook as a function is also accepted. It is converted to an object with the handler property associated to the function.

The `handler` property is the function where the plugin author can listen, intercept and modify the application code. Promises are supported. Handlers can be synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript functions.

The `after` and `before` properties are used to sort the order in which the hook handlers are called. They must refers to a valid plugins name which must have a hook of the same name registered.

## Handler

When the handler defines 1 argument, it can only access and modify the interception point arguments.

When the handler defines 2 arguments, it get access to the original handler or the handler returned by the previous hook. It can then decide to return it, execute it or even return an alternative handler. It can also prevent other hooks from being executed by returning `null`.
