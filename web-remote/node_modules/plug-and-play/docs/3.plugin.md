# Plugin

A plugin group multiple hooks in a same place. As such, it must exports at least one hook inside the `hooks` property.

## Registration

Plug and Play can be initialized with a list of plugins through the `plugins` options:

```js
const plugandplay = require('plug-and-play')
plugandplay({
  plugins: [{
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => { console.log('"my:hook" is called') }
    }
  }]
})
```

Or later on with the `register` function:

```js
const plugandplay = require('plug-and-play')
plugandplay()
.register({
  plugins: [{
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => { console.log('"my:hook" is called') }
    }
  }]
})
```
